## More Plotting, Less Mapping

_[Maps are great](https://imds-dash-home-language-app.herokuapp.com/), but can be distracting!_

This blog will focus on [CMA](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=geo009) specific charts that show changes in HL composition
over time and the differences between CMAs. Hopefully the charts are lucid and
offer simple comparisons.

</div>

Overall objectives:

- Provide HL analysis for all CMAs in Canada
- Included Census data for 2011, 2016 and 2021 using their original Dissemination Area (DA) enumerations (not prorating results to the 2021 DAs, a bit messy)
- Provded side-by-side comparisons
- Get to know Canada a litte better!

## Sample of things to come...
