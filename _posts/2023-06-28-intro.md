An ongoing project looking at ethnic diversity in Canada using "[Language spoken most often at home](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=pop186)" (Home Language, HL). 

The research spans three cencuses: [2011](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E), [2016](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E) and [2021](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E), builds features at the [Dissemination Area level (DA)](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=geo021), and results are
present at the [Census Metropolitan Area (CMA)](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=geo009) level. 

Some effort has gone into showing spatial results with [mapping](https://imds-dash-home-language-app.herokuapp.com/) at the DA
level using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for basic map 'serving'. All research initially used Python, [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) along with [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/).
