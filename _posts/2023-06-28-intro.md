An ongoing project looking at ethnic diversity in Canada using "Language Most Often Spoen at Home" (Home Language, HL). 
The research spans three cencuses: 2011, 2016, and 2021, and builds features at the Dissemination Area level and results are
present at the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) level. Some effort has gone into showing spatial results with mapping at the DA
level using Python, Dash and Heroku for basic map 'serving'. All research initially used Python, QGIS and PostgreSQL.
